        <!-- <a> is an anchor tag that creates a link to an html, or even videos, pdf, images, etc.
            <a> needs a destination, use href to add a hypertext reference attribute.
            An attribute is made of 2 parts:a name, and value. however not all attributes require a value -->

        <!-- To create a link in another tab: add a target attribute inside anchor tag <a>
         The rel attribute is used to describe the relation between current page and linked page.
         The noopener attribute ensures link opened in new tab cant interact with original page, ensures security.
         The noreferrer attribute provides privacy and security, by preventing new page from knowing where the user came from and also include behaviour of noopener
         It is best practice to use target="_blank" with a rel="noopener noreferrer" -->

            <!-- absolute links: links to pages on other website, typically made of following parts: scheme://domain/path. 
            An absolute link will always contain the scheme and domain of the destination.
            The previous example was an example of an absolute link -->

            <!-- Relative links: links to other pages within our own website.
            Relative links dont include the domain name since its on the same website. They only include the file path to the other page. -->

             You can use attribute "src" to tell where the browser file is located (it can embded an image using both relative and absolute paths) -->

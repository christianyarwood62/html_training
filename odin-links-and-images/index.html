        <!-- <a> is an anchor tag that creates a link to an html, or even videos, pdf, images, etc.
            <a> needs a destination, use href to add a hypertext reference attribute.
            An attribute is made of 2 parts:a name, and value. however not all attributes require a value.
            Absolute links always needs to start with https:// -->

        <!-- To create a link in another tab: add a target attribute inside anchor tag <a>
         The rel attribute is used to describe the relation between current page and linked page.
         The noopener attribute ensures link opened in new tab cant interact with original page, ensures security.
         The noreferrer attribute provides privacy and security, by preventing new page from knowing where the user came from and also include behaviour of noopener
         It is best practice to use target="_blank" with a rel="noopener noreferrer" -->

            <!-- absolute links: links to pages on other website, typically made of following parts: scheme://domain/path. 
            An absolute link will always contain the scheme and domain of the destination.
            The previous example was an example of an absolute link -->

            <!-- Relative links: links to other pages within our own website.
            Relative links dont include the domain name since its on the same website. They only include the file path to the other page. -->

            <!-- Because the about.html file is in a different repository, it has to include the pages/ directory since that is the new location of the about file relative to the index file -->
                <a href="pages/about.html">About</a>

            <!-- You can avoid issues with broken links by prepending "./" before the link so it specifies looking for the file/directory relative to the current directory -->
                <a href="./pages/about.html">About</a>

            <!-- You can add images by using closed element <img> (meaning there is no closign tag e.g. </img>).
             You can use attribute "src" to tell where the browser file is located (it can embded an image using both relative and absolute paths) -->

            <!-- You can use the alt attribute after to describe the image if it cant be loaded -->
            <img src="./images/dog.jpg" alt="A dog">
        </p>

        <p>
            <!-- It is good practice to use image size attributes after to layout the page without causing the page to jump and flash -->

    <!-- Best practice for file structure:
     have an img folder, a css folder, a js folder. Keep folder and file names lowercase, and avoid spaces, use hyphens instead.
     Avoid numbers and keep names short as well.
     Name home webpage index.html. -->

     <!-- Image formats:
      - jpg: great for photos or images with lots of gradient int hem, they dont allow for transparent pixels
      - GIF: for simple animations, limited in terms of colour palette, dont use for photos.
      - PNG: great for anything thats not photo or animated. Excellent fit for icons, diagrams and logos, etc.
      - SVG: vector based graphics format, meaning it can scale up or down to any dimension without quality loss. Great for responsive design. Good for all same use cases as PNGs -->

    <!-- This text was added for practice commiting with good practice:
     Seven rules of a good commit:
     1) Separate subject from body with blank line
     2) limit subject to 50 characters
     3) capitilise the subject
     4) do not end the subject line with a period
     5) use the imperative mood in subject line
     6) wrap the body at 72 characters
     7) use the body to explain what and why vs how -->
